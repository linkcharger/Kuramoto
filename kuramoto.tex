\subsection{$r_{\infty}(K)$ -- simulated vs predicted}


\subsubsection{Euler method}

\paragraph{Design and initiation}
My implementation of the Euler method is object-oriented. 
This may not be the computationally most efficient way, but I'm still somewhat of a beginner with code, so I appreciate the clarity that object-oriented programming affords.

The first type of object is simply an \osc with three variables: $\omega, \theta_{t-1}$ and $\theta_t$. 
A $\Delta t = 1$ is enough in the Euler method.
An \osc gets initiated with its natural frequency and the current-period $\theta$. 
The last-period $\theta$ is initiated as zero, since the first part of making an 'Euler step' forwards is to hand over $\theta_{t}$ to $\theta_{t-1}$. 

The other object type is the \oscpop. 
It consists of a list of \texttt{Oscillators} and a construction mode, namely the distribution according to which the $\omega$s are distributed.
When an \oscpop is initiated, for each \osc a natural frequency and initial phase are drawn from the respective type of random distribution. 
An \osc object is then initiated with those values and assigned to a place in the list within the \oscpop object.


\paragraph{Running the simulation}











\subsubsection{Numerical integration}


The strategy to integrate the consistency equation is to loop through different values of $r$ and check which ones make the right-hand side approximately equal to one. 
In a loop around this one, we cycle through the different values for K to get the values of the desired $r_\infty(K)$ relationship.
